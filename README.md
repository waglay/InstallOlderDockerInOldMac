# InstallOlderDockerInOldMac
this repo goes through all the process to undertake if you are struggling to install docker in older mac versions or possibly windows as well

# Steps to undergo according to several community sources

- Step 1: first of all go to the releases repo of docker via: https://github.com/docker/docs/blob/71c6d2d88a0086f36e21705fdf35aa08322d8867/content/desktop/release-notes.md
- Step 2: here find the version you want to install, in my case I wanted compatible version for mac 11.7.10 so I was searching for docker version 4.22.0
- Step 3: After I navigate to my desired version, I will note the build_number and modify the links accordingly (mac: https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/amd64/117440/Docker.dmg ) (windows: https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/110738/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)
- Step 4 : The modification is required after /amd64/ and inplace of 117440 you can replace it with your own build number. 
Note: screenshot of the build number is attached.
